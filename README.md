# 🚀 RESTful API Starter Template

**A lightweight and extensible Node.js & Express.js boilerplate for building your backend services with a structured approach.**

This project provides a foundational RESTful API, perfect for developers looking for a quick start to their backend development. It adopts a more organized structure using `controllers` and `routes` to separate concerns, making it ideal for learning about API design, prototyping a new feature, or serving as a simple yet scalable backend for your frontend application. It showcases basic HTTP request handling, focusing on common methods with JSON data, and includes an example of local data persistence using `node-persist`.

## ✨ Features

  * **Node.js & Express.js Core:** Built on a robust and widely-used stack.
  * **Modular Architecture:** Organized using separate `routes` and `controllers` for better maintainability.
  * **Simple Request Handling:** Demonstrates how to receive and process incoming HTTP requests.
  * **JSON Data Support:** Ready to handle JSON payloads for data exchange.
  * **Local Data Persistence:** Includes `.node-persist` for simple, file-based data storage.
  * **Rapid Development:** Get your API up and running in minutes.

-----

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
  * **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
  * **node-persist:** A simple, lightweight, cross-platform local persistent storage module for Node.js.
  * **JSON:** Standard data interchange format.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your API running locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kauntiaakash2/REST_API.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd REST_API
    ```

3.  **Install the necessary dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the server:**

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

    Your API should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever port is configured in `app.js`).

2.  **(Optional) Using Nodemon for Development:**
    For automatic server restarts during development (highly recommended), install Nodemon globally or locally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon # For global installation
    # OR
    npm install --save-dev nodemon # For local project installation
    ```

    Then, run with Nodemon:

    ```bash
    nodemon app.js
    ```

## 💡 API Endpoints & Usage

This API is structured with dedicated route and controller files. All defined API endpoints can be found in `routes/userRoutes.js`, and their respective logic is implemented in `controllers/userController.js`.

### Example Request (Hypothetical User Route)

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), or `curl` to send requests to your API.

Based on the file structure, a common pattern would be a `/users` endpoint. For example, to create a new user:

```http
Host: localhost:5000
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Example Response (Hypothetical User Creation)

The API would typically respond with a confirmation, possibly including the newly created user's data:

```json

{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "User created successfully",
    "data": {
        "id": "some-unique-id",
        "username": "john_doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
}
```

**To discover the exact endpoints and their required payloads, please examine:**

  * `routes/userRoutes.js` for the defined API paths (e.g., `/users`, `/users/:id`).
  * `controllers/userController.js` for the logic handling each request and the expected input/output.

```

  * **`app.js`**: The main entry point of the application. It initializes Express, connects to any necessary middleware, and imports/mounts the route definitions.
  * **`routes/`**: This directory holds files defining specific API routes (e.g., `userRoutes.js` for user-related endpoints). Each file exports an Express Router.
  * **`controllers/`**: This directory contains the business logic for each route. For example, `userController.js` would contain functions to handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting users.
  * **`.node-persist/`**: This folder is automatically created and used by the `node-persist` library to store your application's data locally in a file-based system.
